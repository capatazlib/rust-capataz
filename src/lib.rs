#![deny(missing_docs)]

//! The capataz crate offers a lightweight, composable supervision tree API
//! inspired by Erlang's OTP which sits on top of the tokio future library. The
//! crate provides:
//!
//! * A `Context` type to signal termination of supervised tasks

/// This module provides the `Context` type which offers a contract to terminate
/// supervised processes futures in a way that is explicit, reliable and safe.
pub mod context;

/// This module provides an internal `Worker` type that tracks the outcome of a
/// wrapped future.
mod worker;
